How to Create and Paint the 3D Printed Castle Model:
(note these instructions are based on my adventure, please modify for your desires)

3D BUILD
-----
1. Download the keep.stl file from @dutchmogul's thingverse file here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:92172/#files

2. Import into Cinema 4D 

3. You need to HOLLOW out the inside of the castle in order to fit the ENTIRE Arduino YUN & Perf Board set up underneath it. Make sure the walls are VERY thin as you want the light to EASILY shine through. I just made a sqaure and fused it into the bottom of the model, there by making that area empty.

4. Print with your 3D Printer. The Mojo only allowed for a 5" model, feel free to print to your favored size. But anything smaller will be UNABLE to fit the Arduino inside.

DESIGN

1. Spray paint the castle your desired color. Grey or silver (Metallic looks the fanciest) allows for the light to shine through. Stay away from dark colors.

2. To get the aged look: Take a plastic bag from a grocery store, crumble it up, dab the wrinkles in a mixture of browns and black paint and then tap lightly on a spare piece of paper before dabbing onto the castle. You want there to be a minimal amount on the bag before touching the castle. This speckling effect can be layed multiple times untile desired effect achieved.

TADA! Killer medieval castle acheived!
