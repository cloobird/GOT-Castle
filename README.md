GOT-Castle
==========

GOT is all about POWER. And LAND. Hold the power of castle ownership through Foursquare Mayorships and an Arduino YUN. When you check-in as a mayor and use #GOTStark (or your favorite House), the castle will light up, shining your power for all to see.

This contains all files need to 3D print, assemble and code your very own castle to use with your Foursquare and Twitter Accounts. Please contact me if you have any issues harnessing your power!
