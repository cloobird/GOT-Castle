STEPS
(You can also refer to the Fritzing Diagram in this repo)

On your perf board we are going to create a simple 1 LED setup.

1. Place the LED near the top, Anode to the left, going horizontal.
2. PLace an Ohm going down vertically from the Cathode side of the LED.
3. Solder the Ohm leg & Cathode leg located next to each other.
4. Place a jumper wire to the left of the bottom Ohm leg.
5. Solder the jumper & Ohm together.
6. Place a jumper wire to the left of the LED's Anode leg.
7. Solder the jumper and Anode legs together.
8. Connect the jumper wire from the LED to PIN 13 on the Arduino YUN.
9. Connect the jumper wire from the Ohm to the GRND on the Arduino YUN.

BOOM! Pretty simple set up for such a magical result.
